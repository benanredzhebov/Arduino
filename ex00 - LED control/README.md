# LED Control Project

## Introduction

This project involves controlling LEDs using an **Arduino Uno** microcontroller. It is designed to help understanding the essentials of programming microcontrollers, working with electronic components, and developing a functional device.

## Hardware Components

The following components are required to complete the project:

- Arduino Uno microcontroller
- ON/OFF switch
- 3 LEDs (Red, Green, and Yellow)
- 3 Resistors (220 Ohms)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Project Objective

### Mandatory Part
- **Green LED**: Initially turned on by default. Pressing the button will turn off the green LED.
- **Red and Yellow LEDs**: Once the green LED is turned off, the red and yellow LEDs will start blinking every second.

### Bonus Part
1. **Red and Yellow LEDs** blink alternately every two seconds.
2. **Red LED** blinks every half second, and the **Yellow LED** blinks every two seconds.
