# Arduino Workshop

Welcome to the **Arduino Workshop** repository! This workshop is organized by [42 Wolfsburg](https://www.42wolfsburg.de) and is designed to introduce participants to the basics of Arduino programming and electronics.

## Workshop Overview

The Arduino Workshop is a collaborative, hands-on experience where participants will work in teams to build and program various projects using Arduino microcontrollers. It provides a great opportunity to explore embedded systems and learn how to interact with hardware components.

### Objectives

- **Understand** the basics of Arduino hardware and programming.
- **Learn** how to use electronic components such as sensors, LEDs, etc.
- **Build** functional projects using Arduino microcontroller.
- **Collaborate** in teams to complete challenging tasks.
- **Present** the final projects to the group where every team will evaluate the other teams work and receive feedback on their own projects.

## Team Setup

Participants will be divided into teams of 3. Each team will work together on a series of projects. Collaboration and problem-solving will be key aspects of the learning process, encouraging participants to share knowledge and skills.

## Projects

The workshop consists of 4 progressively challenging projects. Each project will focus on different aspects of working with the Arduino platform, such as inputs, outputs, sensors, and more.
