# LCD (16x2) Display:
- DB0-DB7: These are the data pins for the LCD (DB = Data Bus). Pins DB0 through DB7 are used to send the 8-bit
  data or commands from the Arduino to the LCD.
- RS (Register Select): This pin tells the LCD whether to treat the incoming data as commands (e.g., clearing
  the screen) or as characters to display.
- RW (Read/Write): This pin controls whether you're reading from or writing to the LCD. Usually tied to GND for
  write mode only (as in this diagram).
- ENA (Enable): This pin is used to latch the data sent to the data pins (DB0-DB7) into the LCD.
- VCC and GND: Provide power to the LCD (5V from the Arduino) and ground connection.
- VO (Contrast Control): Connected to a potentiometer (RPOT1), this adjusts the contrast of the display.
- LED+ and LED-: These power the backlight of the LCD. LED+ connects to 5V, and LED- connects to GND, possibly
  with a resistor in between for current limiting.

# Arduino Uno:
- Digital Pins D2 to D12: These pins are connected to various control and data pins of the LCD. For instance,
  D4-D7 may connect to DB4-DB7 of the LCD in a 4-bit mode setup.
- A0 to A5: These analog pins may not be directly connected to the LCD but can be used for other sensors or
  components (unused here for LCD).
- 5V, GND: Power and ground connections for the LCD and other components.
- RX, TX: Used for serial communication, likely not involved in this specific LCD setup.

# Potentiometer (RPOT1):
- A 10k potentiometer is used to control the contrast of the LED  by adjusting the voltage on the VO pin.
  As you turn the knob, the light on the LED becomes more or less visible.

# Resistors (R1, R2):
- R1 (180Ω): Likely connected to the LED backlight to limit current and prevent burning out the backlight.
- R2 (10kΩ): Possibly connected to the potentiometer to fine-tune the contrast control.

# Power Supply:
- U1_5V: This indicates a 5V power supply for the components.
- U1_GND: Ground connection for the circuit.

# Other Pins and Components:
- IOREF, RES, VIN: These are standard Arduino pins used for reference voltage, reset, and power input.
- SDA, SCL: These are I2C communication pins, not directly used in this schematic for the LCD but may be relevant
  for other sensors.
- D1 (RED LED): A red LED is included in the circuit, possibly for an indication or status light, connected to one
  of the Arduino digital pins through a resistor (R2).

Functionality:
The Arduino controls the LCD display by sending commands and data over the data bus (DB0-DB7 or DB4-DB7 in 4-bit mode).
The potentiometer adjusts the contrast of the LCD, making the characters more or less visible.
The resistors protect the components from excessive current, especially the LED backlight and any connected LEDs.
