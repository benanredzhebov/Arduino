# Servo Control

## Introduction

Servo motors are highly efficient and precise rotary actuators that find extensive use in a wide array
of applications. Equipped with integrated feedback systems, these motors continuously monitor and adjust
their rotational position to maintain precise control. The feedback loop, often using position sensors
like encoders or resolvers, enables the motor controller to compare the actual shaft position with the
desired position and make real-time adjustments, ensuring accuracy and stability even under varying loads
or disturbances. As a result, servo motors are crucial cumponents in robotics, powering precise movements
in robotic arms and manipulators, as well as in industrial automation for CNC machines, providing accurate
tool positioning for manufacturing processes.
The versatility of servo motors extends to other fields as well. In consumer electronics, they drive the
precise movements of camera gimbals, enhancing image stabilization in photography and videography.
Furthermore, servo motors play an essential role in medical equipment, where precise and controlled motion
is vital for procedures such as robotic-assisted surgeries. With their ability to deliver consistent and
repeatable performance, servo motors have revolutionized various industries, empowering automation and
robotics while enabling enhanced efficiency and accuracy in a multitude of applications.

## Hardware components

The following components are required to complete the project:

- A microcontroller (ARDUINO UNO)
- 2 Servo motors
- 3 Light sensors - photoresistors
- A breadboard
- Jumper wires
- 3 10KOhm resistors

## Project Objective

### Mandatory Part

Design and implement a light-following system using Arduiono  Uno, a
servo motor, and up to three sensors. The project should enable the servo
motor to move and orient itself in the direction of a light source detected by
the sensors. Students should perform testing to verify the accuracy of their
light detection algorithm and motor movement. You can adjust the sensor
poistioning. algorithm parameters, or servo motor angles as needed to
enhance performance.

The LCD display should be updated in real-time as the potentiometer value
changes.
